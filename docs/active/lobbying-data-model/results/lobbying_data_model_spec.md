# Lobbying Data Model Specification

**Version:** 0.1 (draft for fellow review)
**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Branch:** `lobbying-data-model`
**Status:** Draft — circulate for feedback, then finalize before pipeline work begins

---

## Purpose

This document defines the **universal output data model** for the lobby_analysis project. Every fellow's state pipeline — regardless of how different the source portal is — must produce JSON that conforms to this schema. The model is the contract that lets 50 independent pipelines interoperate.

The model also defines a **State Master Record** per state that captures what that state's law requires, so we can programmatically distinguish "this state doesn't require this field" from "this filer failed to report a required field." This enables the compliance monitoring use case.

## Design Principles

1. **Store source faithfully, transform later.** Pipelines write what the state discloses. Normalization, cross-state entity resolution, and analytics are separate layers.
2. **Union schema with nullable fields.** The schema includes every field any state could populate. `null` means "not present in this record." The State Master Record tells you whether it *should* have been present.
3. **Hierarchies where they naturally exist.** A filing contains positions, expenditures, engagements, and gifts. We preserve that nesting. A fellow with graph DB experience will handle cross-entity linking downstream.
4. **Field-level provenance** on anything extracted by LLM or regex. Direct-copy structured fields use filing-level provenance.
5. **Amendment chain, not overwrites.** Each amendment is a new filing record with a `supersedes` link. `is_current` flag for easy filtering.

## Entity Details

### Person

Follows Popolo (OCDEP 5). Single display name — no first/middle/last segmentation.

**Name convention:** `name` is always a display-ready string (e.g., "Jane Q. Doe"). When a state portal provides name components separately (first, middle, last), assemble them into `name` and preserve the original components in `name_components` as a labeled dict. This avoids re-splitting from first principles when the source already gave us the parts.

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| id | str | yes | Pipeline-assigned UUID |
| name | str | yes | Display-ready name (e.g., "Jane Q. Doe") |
| name_components | dict[str, str] | no | Original components if source provided them separately (e.g., `{"first": "Jane", "middle": "Q.", "last": "Doe"}`). Null if source gave a single string. |

**ContactDetail:** `{ type: "address"|"phone"|"email"|"website", value: str, note: str }`
**Identifier:** `{ scheme: str, identifier: str }` — scheme examples: `"open_states"`, `"lobbyview"`, `"state_registration"`

## State Master Record

One per state. Captures what the state's disclosure law requires, derived from PRI disclosure-law + FOCAL scoring results. This is what makes compliance monitoring possible.

### Structure

```

├── state: "CA"
├── state_name: "California"
├── version: "2026-Q1"

└── notes: str  (free-text for anything that doesn't fit)
```

### Compliance Check Logic

State Master Records are versioned with `effective_start` / `effective_end` dates. When checking compliance for a filing, use the version whose effective period contains the filing's `reporting_period_start`. This way, if Texas raises its de minimis threshold in 2027, filings from 2026 are still checked against the 2026 rules.

Given a `LobbyingFiling` and the `StateMasterRecord` for its state:

```python
for req in state_master.field_requirements:
    if req.reporting_party == filing.filer_role and req.status == "required":
        value = get_field(filing, req.field_path)
        if value is None:
            flag_compliance_gap(filing, req)
```

### Cross-Reporting Consistency

The `reporting_parties` list enables a powerful check: if a state requires both lobbyists and clients to file activity reports, and only the lobbyist filed, the missing client report is detectable even before examining field-level completeness.

For states where multiple parties report overlapping data (e.g., both lobbyist and client report expenditure totals), the amounts should be reconcilable. Discrepancies are a compliance signal — analogous to third-party reporting in tax enforcement.

---

## Pipeline Output Format

Each fellow's pipeline produces one JSON file per filing, validated against the pydantic models.

### Directory structure

```
data/extracted/<STATE>/
├── registrations/
│   └── <registration_id>.json    → LobbyistRegistration
├── filings/
│   └── <filing_id>.json          → LobbyingFiling
├── persons/
│   └── <person_id>.json          → Person (deduplicated within state)
├── organizations/
│   └── <org_id>.json             → Organization (deduplicated within state)
└── state_master.json             → StateMasterRecord
```

### Validation

Every JSON file must deserialize cleanly into its pydantic model. Pipelines should validate before writing:

```python
from lobby_analysis.models import LobbyingFiling

filing = LobbyingFiling(**extracted_data)
filing.model_validate(filing)  # pydantic validation
path.write_text(filing.model_dump_json(indent=2))
```

## What This Model Does NOT Cover (Yet)

These are explicitly deferred to later phases:

1. **Cross-state entity resolution.** The `CrossStateOrgIdentifier` that links "Pfizer Inc." across states. Separate enrichment layer, biggest open methodological question.
2. **Compliance layer entities.** `Violation`, `Referral`, `Penalty` — first-class entities in the design, but not part of the extraction pipeline output. Built from State Master Record + filing data + external enforcement records.
3. **Analytics/aggregation views.** Per-state totals, time series, network graphs. Downstream of this model.
4. **External ID linkage.** Open States, OpenCorporates, SEC CIK, LobbyView. Separate enrichment layer.

---

## Open Questions for Fellow Review

1. **Is the entity list complete?** Does any fellow's assigned state have a disclosure type not covered by these entities?
2. **Field granularity.** Are there fields that should be split finer or merged? (e.g., should `total_compensation` and `total_reimbursements` be a single `total_costs` field?)
3. **Engagement entity.** Only ~8 states require contact-level logging. Is it worth the complexity in the universal model, or should it be a state-specific extension?
4. **Gift vs. Expenditure.** Some states report gifts as a subcategory of expenditures, not separately. Should `Gift` remain a separate entity, or become an expenditure category?
5. **State Master Record population.** The scoring branch will produce PRI/FOCAL scores per state. Should we auto-generate State Master Records from those scores, or should each fellow manually verify their states' requirements?
6. **De minimis thresholds.** The PRI rubric captures whether a threshold exists and its value. Should the State Master Record also capture the *conditions* under which the threshold applies (e.g., "compensation threshold applies only to in-house lobbyists")?

---

## Rubric Traceability

Every field in this model traces back to a PRI or FOCAL rubric item. This is intentional — the rubrics were designed by researchers who surveyed the full landscape of lobbying disclosure requirements. If a state requires something not in the rubrics, we add a field and note the gap.

| Model Field | PRI Item(s) | FOCAL Indicator(s) |

| LobbyingExpenditure.amount | E1f_i–iii, E2f_i–iii | 7.6, 7.8 |
| LobbyingExpenditure.category | E1f_iii, E2f_iii | 7.9, 7.10 |
| LobbyingEngagement.* | E1i, E2i | 8.1–8.11 |
| Gift.* | E1f_iii, E2f_iii | 7.10 |
| Filing frequency | E1h_*, E2h_* | 2.1, 2.2 |
